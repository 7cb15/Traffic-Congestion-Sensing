# Urban-Sensing
Measuring traffic congestion and noise pollution with computer vision and noise sensors. We use a image data and noise sensor data to measure the impact of traffic congestion on noise pollution. Traffic congestion is measured by implementing a computer vision model using Open CV.

**Location observed**: Jay St (between Willoughby and Johnson), Brooklyn, NY
